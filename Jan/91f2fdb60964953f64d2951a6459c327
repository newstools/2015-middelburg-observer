An overall pass rate of 97,3% was achieved. These results echo nearly 30 years of consistently high matriculation results, with pass rates of over 97% every year. Most telling however, was that 46.4% of candidates attained a Bachelors pass, enabling them to further their studies at a university, while 49.1% attained a Diploma pass. Overall, candidates received a total of 69 subject distinctions. Five candidates attained four distinctions while many attained three. Individual subject averages were excellent – only one subject averaged below 52% with outstanding higher averages for all other subjects. The pride and joy of Steelcrest High School is Azhraa Mahomed Latif who achieved seven distinctions, scoring over 90% in six of her seven subjects. She received an award and various prizes in Barberton this morning for being one of the top ten achievers in the province!
